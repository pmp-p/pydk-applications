Tools and samples for building mobile/web apps with Python

This will cover only the web part, android prebuilts are huge (and quite unsafe) : build them yourself with PyDK.
or use the libwapy.so prebuilt, note that you'll need to link your "android-sdk" folder into the minimalist ./pydk/


Here is offered a webassembly loader, which is a CPython interpreter, a big part of CPython stdlib and also Panda3D modules.


Since not everybody runs a webserver, a small Python3.7+ utility is provided to let you test you run apps.

It shows a web menu to let you pick up samples and try them.
